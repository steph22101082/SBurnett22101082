                    A trait/emotion that impacted me throughout my school life is discipline. Although not necessarily considered an emotion, it's a good characteristic to keep if you want to succeed in life. Many times I've felt dejected and tired and want to give up throughout my years of attending school, but the discipline of wanting to achieve something great keeps me from staying down. Even if I'm at my lowest, I try to at least take a break and then get right back to what needs to be done, whether I want to or not. At the end of the day, it's up to me to be successful or not.

			<h1>My Hero</h1>
			<h2>Mike Tyson</h2>
			<p>Mike Tyson is a legendary former professional boxer renowned for his exceptional talent and remarkable career. What makes Tyson an inspiring hero to many is his unwavering discipline and commitment to his craft. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, Tyson's relentless work ethic and dedication to boxing propelled him to become the youngest heavyweight champion in history. His ability to overcome adversity and maintain his focus in the face of adversity serves as a compelling example of what discipline can achieve. Mike Tyson's story inspires me because it underscores the incredible feats one can accomplish through sheer determination and hard work.
			</p>
			<br>

            <p>Mike Tyson once said, "Discipline is doing what you hate to do but doing it like you love it." I find this to be very true because that's what's needed to get through the hardest times one can.</p>

			<p>These traits, according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), certainly resonate with certain aspects of my personality, but they don't capture the entirety of who I am. While I do identify as introverted and observant, and lean more towards feeling than thinking, the strong judging and turbulent tendencies mentioned aren't always the dominant features of my character. I might not always come across as assertive or judgmental, but these traits are still a part of me. They manifest differently depending on the situation or context, but they do contribute to the complexity and uniqueness of my personality.
